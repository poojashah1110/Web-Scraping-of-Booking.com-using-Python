# Web-Scraping-of-Booking.com-with-Python
In this project, I collected data of hotels listed on Booking.com in Lille, France for a duration of 1 year from December 2020 to November 2021. The data was extracted by web scraping and analysed using Python 3 in Jupyter Notebook. Some key variables used used for analysis include area in Lille, price per night, accomodation type, ratings & reviews, additional services like breakfast and free cancellation. A detailed analysis and interpretation is explained in the Powerpoint presentation.
