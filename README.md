# Web-Scraping-of-Booking.com-using-Python
In this project, I extracted data from Booking.com for hotels listed in Lille, France for a duration of 1 year from December 2020 to November 2021. The data was processed and analysed using Python 3 in Jupyter Notebook. Some key variables used for conducting exploratory data analysis include area in Lille, price per night, accomodation type, ratings & reviews, additional services like breakfast and free cancellation. A data visualization and interpretation is presented in the analysis report.
